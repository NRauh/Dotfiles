# Dotfiles

## Setup

Have [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) installed.
(Terminal preset uses MesloLGMDZ Nerd Font)

For zsh, install [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to `~/.antigen.zsh`

## Loading dotfiles

Install `stow` and run `stow -S stow` from this directory

### Post stow

Run `cp ~/.zshrc-local.rename ~/.zshrc-local`

# Terminal Presets

iTerm 2 settings can be applied by changing the settings directory
(General -> Preferences -> Load preferences from a custom folder or URL).

# Programs

Here's a list of programs I commonly will install.

## VSCode

[This gist](https://gist.github.com/tegandbiscuits/dfc127a60242d9b110ca355cbb0440f0) can be used with the [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) plugin.

## CLI

- [`brew`](https://brew.sh/)
- [`n`](https://github.com/tj/n)
  - This can be installed with `brew`
- [`rvm`](https://rvm.io/)

## Mac

These are a few smaller programs that I think help make Mac programming more comfortable.

* [Sensible Side Buttons](https://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net/)
* [Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/)
