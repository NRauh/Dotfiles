Dotfiles
========

Use `stow` on the directory with dotfiles you want to use.

For `zsh`, run: `cp ~/.zshrc-local.rename ~/.zshrc-local`

For `vim`, be sure to install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

Install [bullet train](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train.zsh) theme. Install [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) if using bullet train theme.

Programs Installed
==================

This is a list of the programs I have installed.

In some cases these need to be installed for the config files to work
as intended (afaik they won't break), in others they're just notes to
myself for what to install on a fresh system.

* fonts-powerline
* zsh
* git
* oh-my-zsh
* bullettrain theme
